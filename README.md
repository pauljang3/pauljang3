## Hi there, I'm Paul! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an IT professional focused on building my career in IT support. On this page, you'll find repositories that showcase my journey through help desk practice, troubleshooting, and customer interaction in both real-world and simulated scenarios.

### Portfolio Projects

- **[Help Desk Experience](https://github.com/pauljang3/HelpDesk-Experience)**  
  A collection of real-world IT issues I’ve solved in a SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) environment, alongside mock problems created for practice. This repository includes Jira tickets that demonstrate how I resolved common IT challenges, such as network drive issues, software conflicts, and printer troubleshooting.

- **[Home Lab](https://github.com/pauljang3/HomeLab)**  
  I set up a virtualized Active Directory environment using Oracle VM VirtualBox to experiment with domain management, networking, and automating administrative tasks. This project covers configuring a Domain Controller, setting up DHCP and NAT, and automating user account creation with PowerShell scripts.

Feel free to explore my projects and provide feedback! I'm always looking for ways to grow and improve my IT skills.  

Looking forward to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts! 🖧
