## Hi there, I'm Paul! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an IT professional working on building my career in IT support. On this page, you'll find repositories showcasing my journey through help desk practice, troubleshooting, and customer interaction in both real-world and simulated scenarios.

### Portfolio Projects
- **[Help Desk Experience:](https://github.com/pauljang3/HelpDesk-Experience)A collection of real-world IT issues Iâ€™ve solved in a SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) environment, along with mock problems created for practice. This includes Jira tickets that demonstrate how I resolved common IT challenges, such as network drive issues, software conflicts, and printer troubleshooting.
- **[Home Lab](https://github.com/pauljang3/HomeLab)**: I set up a virtualized Active Directory environment using Oracle VM VirtualBox to experiment with domain management, networking, and automating administrative tasks. This hands-on project involved configuring a Domain Controller, DHCP, NAT, and automating user account creation with PowerShell scripts.

Feel free to explore my projects and provide feedback! I'm always looking for ways to grow and improve my IT skills.  

Looking forward to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts! ðŸŒ±
